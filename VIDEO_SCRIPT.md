## üìù **SCRIPT OUTLINE**

### **Opening (0:00 - 0:20)**
**Visual**: Quick dashboard overview, then transition to code editor

**Narration**: 
> "The Hummingbird Monitor is an AI-powered system that automatically identifies birds, tracks visits, and generates intelligent summaries. Let me show you the code behind this system and the AI patterns that make it work."

---

### **System Overview (0:20 - 0:40)**
**Visual**: Show project structure, main.py, and key directories

**Narration**:
> "Built with FastAPI and React, the system has a clean modular architecture. The backend handles AI processing, while the frontend provides real-time monitoring. Let's dive into the AI components."

---

### **AI Bird Identification (0:40 - 1:30)**
**Visual**: Show `backend/app/services/bird_identification.py`

**Narration**:
> "The core AI functionality starts here in the bird identification service. We use CodeProject.AI for object detection and OpenAI embeddings for bird recognition."

**Visual**: Highlight key methods in the code

**Narration**:
> "The `identify_bird` method processes images through computer vision, then uses vector similarity search to match against known birds. The `add_bird_to_database` method stores new bird embeddings for future recognition."

**Visual**: Show vector database integration, FAISS/Pinecone code

**Narration**:
> "We use FAISS for local vector storage or Pinecone for cloud-based similarity search. Each bird gets a unique embedding that represents their visual features."

---

### **AI Summary Generation (1:30 - 2:15)**
**Visual**: Show `backend/app/services/summary_generator.py`

**Narration**:
> "The summary generator uses LangChain and OpenAI to create intelligent daily reports. Notice how we configure different LLM temperatures for creative vs analytical summaries."

**Visual**: Highlight the LangChain integration and prompt engineering

**Narration**:
> "The `generate_daily_summary` method aggregates visit data and uses structured prompts to generate natural language summaries. We extract statistics, identify patterns, and create human-readable insights."

**Visual**: Show the prompt templates and data formatting methods

**Narration**:
> "The system uses sophisticated prompt engineering to ensure consistent, informative summaries. Each summary type has specialized prompts and data processing."

---

### **AI Alert Logic (2:15 - 2:45)**
**Visual**: Show `backend/app/services/feeder_alert_logic.py`

**Narration**:
> "The alert system uses predictive analytics to determine when feeders need attention. It calculates nectar depletion rates and predicts maintenance needs based on visit patterns."

**Visual**: Highlight the prediction algorithms and seasonal adjustments

**Narration**:
> "The `calculate_nectar_depletion` method uses machine learning patterns to predict feeder status. It considers seasonal variations, bird behavior patterns, and historical data."

---

### **Code Architecture & AI Integration (2:45 - 3:00)**
**Visual**: Show API routes, schemas, and the complete AI pipeline

**Narration**:
> "The entire system is built with AI-first architecture. From capture ingestion to final summaries, every component is designed for intelligent processing. The code is open source and ready for deployment."

**Visual**: Show GitHub repository, documentation links

**Narration**:
> "Check out the GitHub repository for the complete implementation, including detailed documentation and setup guides."
